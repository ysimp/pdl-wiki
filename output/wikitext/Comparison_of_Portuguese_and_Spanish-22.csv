Spelling, Pronunciation, Notes
 Spanish, Portuguese
 b, {{IPA|[b ~ ?]}}, {{IPA|[b ~ ?]}} (EP) {{IPA|[b]}} (BP), In Spanish and European Portuguese {{IPA|/b/}} is lenited after a continuant.
 d, {{IPA|[d ~ ð]}}, {{IPA|[d ~ ð]}} (EP) {{IPA|[d ~ d?]}} (BP), In Spanish and European Portuguese {{IPA|/d/}} is lenited after a continuant. In all Portuguese dialects  the consonants {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} have affricate allophones  happening when before a palatalizing {{IPA|/i/}} ({{IPA|[{{IPAplink|d?}}i ~ {{IPAplink|d?}}i]}}  {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|t?}}i ~ {{IPAplink|t?}}i]}}  mainly in Brazil)  or an elided {{IPA|/?/ ~ /e?/ ~ /?/}} or unstressed {{IPA|/i/}} before another (that actually becomes {{IPA|/?/}} in Portugal)  stressed one  leading to sandhi ({{IPA|[dVz]}} ? {{IPAblink|dz}}  {{IPA|[dVs]}} ? {{IPAblink|ts}}  {{IPA|[tVs] ? [ts]}}  both in Brazil and Portugal).
 t, {{IPA|[t]}}, {{IPA|[t]}} (EP) {{IPA|[t ~ t?]}} (BP)
 g, {{IPA|[? ~ ?]}}, {{IPA|[? ~ ?]}} (EP) {{IPA|[?]}} (BP), In Spanish and European Portuguese {{IPA|/?/}} is lenited after a continuant.
 -l, {{IPA|[l]}}, {{IPA|[?]}} (EP) {{IPA|[w]}} (BP), In European Portuguese syllable-final {{IPA|/l/}} is velarized {{IPAblink|?}} as in Catalan (see dark l)  while in most Brazilian dialects and some rural European ones it is vocalized to {{IPAblink|w}}. Caipira rhoticizes to English-like ar  while portunhol da pampa velarizes it.
 r-  -rr-, {{IPA|[r]}}, {{IPA|[?]}}, In Portuguese  r- and -rr- have several possible pronunciations. In most dialects  it is a guttural r as in French ({{IPA|[?]}}  {{IPA|[?]}} and {{IPA|[?]}} in Portugal and Brazil  {{IPA|[x]}}  {{IPA|[?]}}  {{IPA|[?]}}  {{IPA|[h]}} and {{IPA|[?]}} in Brazil)  while in rural northern Portugal and southern Brazil it is a trilled r {{IPAblink|r}} (like in Galician). In some southern and western Brazilian dialects word final -r may be a tap (as in Portugal and Galicia)  though English-like {{IPAblink|?}}  {{IPAblink|?}} or {{IPAblink|?}} is more common  while in northern and eastern dialects it is guttural. In Spanish  r- and -rr- have kept their original pronunciation as an alveolar trill {{IPAblink|r}}. Intervocalic -r- is an alveolar tap in both languages {{IPAblink|?}}.
 v, {{IPA|[b ~ ?]}}, {{IPA|[v]}}, Originally  the letters ?b? and ?v? stood for distinct sounds pronounced {{IPAblink|b}} and {{IPAblink|?}}  respectively  but the two eventually merged into a single phoneme in Spanish. In most varieties of Portuguese they remained separate phonemes  and the bilabial fricative {{IPA|[?]}} of Old Portuguese subsequently changed into the labiodental fricative {{IPAblink|v}}  as in French and Italian.
