This depends case-by-case on the RAID controller  operating system  and tools. As of 2012 inroads have been made into this  as RAID becomes wider used  but is still far from assured and not supported by all controllers  systems  or tools.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}}}, Shows S.M.A.R.T. attributes, Hard drive self-testing, Notification, Notes
